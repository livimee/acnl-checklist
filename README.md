# acnl-checklist
Interactive checklist for museum items (fish, bugs, fossils, art) in Animal Crossing: New Leaf.

---Work in progress---

acnl.py is the main program that edits and displays the checklists. (very simple)

The lists are just text files. The data in the lists comes from the acnl wiki, and I'm not sure if they
are 100% accurate. The name of each item in the lists should correspond to how it is displayed in the game. 
The uploaded lists are not completely blank at the moment, but they should be.

listedit.py is a tool I used to originally format the lists. 

What needs to be done:
-Fix lists

-Account for capitilization

-Add an option to clear the lists and start over.

-Add more types of collectable objects (diving stuff, fruit, shells, etc.)

-Add encyclopedia information (where/when to find objects, descriptions)

-Improve UI

-Add comments to code

-???
